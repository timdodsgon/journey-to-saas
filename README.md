# Transitioning from a JSP/Servlet Monolith to AWS Serverless SaaS Platform
### Authored by Tim Dodgson, Principal Software Engineer

## Introduction
In the rapidly changing software landscape, moving from traditional monolithic architectures to serverless paradigms has become crucial. Our journey from a legacy JSP/Servlet application to AWS Serverless was marked by embracing new technologies, meticulous planning, and architectural transformation, aimed at achieving scalability and flexibility.

---

## The Monolithic Conundrum
Our initial JSP/Servlet monolith, while stable, faced scalability and adaptability challenges. The architecture's tightly coupled components hindered updates and scalability, necessitating a shift toward a more modular, flexible approach.

## Embracing AWS Serverless: A Strategic Shift
The decision to migrate to a serverless model with AWS was driven by the need for scalability and an event-driven operational model. AWS Serverless, with its capability for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), provided a path for us to automate and manage our infrastructure with precision and efficiency.

---

## Blueprinting the Rebuild
In blueprinting our serverless transition, we focused on defining clear objectives and target architecture. Embracing the IaC model, we used AWS CloudFormation to script and manage our serverless resources, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in our deployments.

---

## Architecting the Serverless Foundation
Our serverless infrastructure, leveraging AWS Lambda, CloudFront, and DynamoDB, emphasized loose coupling and independent scalability. AWS AppConfig was instrumental in our approach, allowing us to externalize configuration data, enabling a single codebase and paving the way for future enhancements, such as client-specific UIs for website administration.

---

## Detailed: AWS Infrastructure Design
Our AWS serverless infrastructure focuses on:
- **CloudFront:** Directs traffic and reduces latency.
- **Lambda Functions:** Handle business logic in independently scalable units.
- **DynamoDB:** Provides scalable NoSQL database services.
- **S3:** Stores static assets, distributed through CloudFront.
- **Lambda@Edge and CloudFront Functions:** Enhance global content delivery.

## Metrics and Dynatrace Integration
Dynatrace's advanced monitoring features provide real-time insights into our system's performance. This integration has been crucial in managing and optimizing our serverless operations.

---

## Next.js and OpenNext: Advancing Serverless SaaS Architecture
Choosing Next.js was strategic for its rendering capabilities. The integration with OpenNext optimizes Next.js for serverless deployment. Additionally, using Next.js enabled us to onboard developers more efficiently, as its growing popularity means many developers are already familiar with its ecosystem.

---

## Migration and Data Transition Tactics
Our migration strategy involved sophisticated data migration scripts and middleware abstraction layers, ensuring seamless integration with our new serverless components and maintaining business continuity.

---

## Benefits of Serverless Reengineering
The move to serverless architecture brought scalability, improved performance, and cost-effectiveness. AWS Tagging allowed us to track costs per client, providing transparency and better cost management.

---

## The Path Forward: Iterative Innovation
With our serverless foundation, we plan to enhance monitoring with AWS CloudWatch and X-Ray and improve our CI/CD processes using AWS services for faster, more reliable deployments.

---

## Reflections on the Serverless Journey
Transitioning to a serverless SaaS platform involved challenges in decoupling the monolith, adopting a serverless mindset, and precise data migration. Effective cost management was achieved through granular tracking using AWS Tagging.

---

## Conclusion
Our transformation to an AWS serverless SaaS platform demonstrates our commitment to technological advancement and sets a new standard for scalability and operational efficiency.
